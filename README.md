# Python-Challenges

In my junior year of high school, a teacher at my school named Matt posted weekly programming challenges. I completed every challenge, and Matt verified each of my solutions. Many of the questions were pulled directly from or take inspiration from Project Euler, linked [here](https://projecteuler.net/).

At the top of each file is the question in a comment, and running the code will provide the solution. Note that there is are several files that require one of the txt word lists, so if you wish to run the code, be sure to download the relevant txt file as well.
