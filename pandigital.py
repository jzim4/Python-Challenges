#We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of
#all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number,
#15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
#The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254,
#containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
#Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
#can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
